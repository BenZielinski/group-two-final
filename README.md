This repository contains code for Info 201 Sp 18 Group two final project. <br/>Group's members are Benjiamin Zielinski, Jin Yan, Kevin Li, and Yusha Wang. <br/>Group's topic is bicycle usage in Seattle. Our project uses bicycle trip data collected by Seattle's cycle share system which are from Pronto Cycle Share organization. Our data focus the bike users in Seattle from 2014 to 2016. There are more than two hundred thousand biking trips that are recorded inside the data frames so we assume the data sets reflect Seattle bikers overall. We plan to use these data sets to analysis:

    * The trend in shared bike usage daily or monthly or even annually
    * How bike uses are affected by user character, stations, and weather
    * what is the most popular biking trips. 
<br/>There are three main data frame from the data sets we are using. The first one is a shared bike station file which describes the stations' information such as where the station is, how long do the station operate, what is the name of the station. The second one is a trip file which contains information about the character of users and biking trip for each user. The third one is a weather file which presents weather condition on a specific date. It's good to notice that each station has a unique identifier so it's easy to track where users pick the bicycle and where they park the bicycle with known duration. If you want to know more information about the original data sets, check out this original data sets Users can do interaction with our Shiny app and explore data on their own.
